SQL is a domain specific language and journal specific languages
SQL is procedural - > what to do and how to do 

Schema - a proper structure with their datatypes arranged in rows/columns/dataframe with a proper definition(int,float,bool)

DDL - create,drop,alter,truncate

drop - table or database 
truncate -> helps to delete the rows and clearing the data but the attributes remain the same 

primary key - a single or a combination of the field which help us to identify the table or the record uniquely, it will restricted to cannot be null and can contain duplicate and one 
primary key.

primary and unique key no duplicates allowed 
primary key cannot have null values and unique key can have null values.

error code - 1062 - duplicate name error 


Root Password Postgre SQL - Pwd - Seems1994#crazy, server pwd,   port - 5432 default

postgredql 15 pwd - Seemscrazy1994#

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\PostgreSQL 15 - back up is in E drive

solution--------------- for fatal error 


In the end the solution that work for me was:

Delete C:\Users\Seema\AppData\Roaming\pgadmin
Open the terminal and run C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\pgAdmin 4\web\__pycache__\config.cpython-310.pyc file using python
Terminal view -> python execution

Run as administrator the "pgAdmin 4" app from the windows menu and it will work as expected
